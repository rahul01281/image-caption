# image-caption
Image Captioning is the process of generating textual description of the image, here the input is the image and the output is the caption.

Dataset used for this project is Flickr8k (available on Kaggle)

we also used a pre-trained Glove model('glove.6B.200d.txt') to create an embedding matrix for all the words in our vocabulary.
